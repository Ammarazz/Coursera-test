            <h2> CHICKEN </h2>
            <!-- Your content for the tall section goes here --><p> Cooking chicken is so easy, anyone can do it. But if that's the case, why do professional chefs cook chicken so much better than we do? It's because the pros know how to select and prepare ingredients, and follow each step of a recipe or technique towards a delicious meal. Of course, chefs are also trained specialists, so their finished dishes tend to have that mouth-watering, photo-worthy look. So what's the secret to getting similar results when cooking for the family? Cook like the pros do â€” we'll show you how.
Chicken is the most popular meat in the United States, with the average American consuming about a hundred pounds of chicken each year. Owing to its budget-friendly price point, versatility, protein content, and a mild flavor that takes well to any number of preparations (from beginner to advanced), chicken remains one of the country's favorite meals.
Poultry isn't just popular in the United States, it's beloved all over the world. Most meat-eating cultures cook with chicken and pass down traditional recipes through the generations. You'll find any number of variations on whole roast chicken seasoned with regional flavors, as well as recipes for braising, frying, poaching, grilling, and soup.
